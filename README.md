# Civic Reach

https://civic-reach.herokuapp.com

Civic Reach is a web application that serves as a platform for nonprofit and government organizations to post events, volunteer opportunities, and donation needs. This then allows concerned members of the community to easily find out how they can help their own communities all in one place.

## Setup - Local Use
1. Install all package dependencies using `npm install`.
2. Set up the database with `/models/schema.sql`.
3. Modify `/config/config.json` to include your MySQL username and password.
4. Get an API key from [OpenCage Data](https://opencagedata.com/api).
5. Create a `.env` file that includes your OpenCage Geocoding API key without any quotes. It should look like the following:
    ```
    # OpenCage Geocoding API key

    OCD_API_KEY=your-api-key
    ```
6. Run server with `npm start`
