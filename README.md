# Project-2 Team-2

Brige the gap between concerned citizens and local non-profits and govenment orgs AND information.

An application where government and non-profit organizations can post events, volunteer opportunities and donation needs for concerned members of the community who want to help but don't know how.


As a citizen who wants to make a difference in my community but doesn't know how, I want to view posted events, opportunities and needs in my community.

As a citizen, I want to be able to see events near me (not necessarily on a map).

As a citizen having a food drive (for example), I want to be able to filter local org needs.

As an organization, I want to post events, volunteer opportunities and donation needs for concerned members of the community who want to help but don't know how.

# Future Features:
- What does my Mayor and local government have to say about the issues I'm concerned with?
- As a citizen, I want to be able to see a map of events near me.

# Meeting Project Requirements
- We're going to use a MySql database to store different organizations, events, and donation needs.
- GET is get all orgs, events, and needs.
- POST is orgs being able to post their org, events, and needs.
- Planning to deploy on Heroku
- Currently thinking about using passport.js as our user authentication middleware. This would be our additional library requirement.
